Kingdom_Hearts
==============

Final Project done for my Introduction to Computer Gaming in C++ using the AGK library.

Run the template.exe file to play the game.

NOTE!!!!!: There is a sllght bug in the code where your health is cut in half because I was testing something quickly. 
Unfortunately, I can't re-compile the code because the AGK library only works with Visual Studio 2008 and '10, and I have 
2012 installed.
